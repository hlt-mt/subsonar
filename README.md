# SONAR Subtitling Evaluator

Code to evaluate the quality of SRT files using the multilingual multimodal [SONAR sentence embedding model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SONAR).

The evaluation accounts for the semantic similarity (computed as a cosine similarity)
between each subtitle block and the corresponding audio to which the block is assigned to
(through the timestamps in the SRT). The returned scores range in `[-1, 1]`
where the higher, the better.


## Installation

Ensure that you have `libsndfile` installed in you environment.
Then, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The installation has been tested with python 3.8 and 3.10.

## Usage

Example usage for Italian SRTs and English audios of two files (1 and 2):

```bash
subsonar \
  --srt-files 1.srt 2.srt \
  --audio-files 1.wav 2.wav \
  --text-lang ita_Latn --audio-lang eng \
  -bs 32
```

Please set the batch size `bs` according to your GPU capacity.

The available languages for the speech encoder (`--audio-lang`) can be found in the
[SONAR repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SONAR/blob/main/README.md#supported-languages-and-download-links),
while the text encoder (`--text-lang`) supports the
[200 languages of NLLB](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/nllb/examples/nllb/modeling/scripts/flores200/langs.txt).
